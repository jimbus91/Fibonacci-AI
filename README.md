This code is using the yfinance library to download historical stock data for a specified stock ticker symbol, then it does some data preprocessing, such as converting the date column to a datetime object, calculating the moving average and Fibonacci retracements, and then it splits the data into features (X) and target (y). After that, it uses the HistGradientBoostingRegressor from scikit-learn to fit the model with the data and make predictions for the next 30 days. Then it creates a dataframe with these predictions, calculates the standard deviation of the last year's close prices, and generates a plot to visualize the predictions, including the standard deviation as a range around the predictions.
